# Local-Hytale-server-mods-updater
bash script for quickly updating mods that are local on your machine to your self hosted server

## Steps
1. set up curseforge and download your mods
2. update your script to match your curseforge mods location (Linux users will need to run a windows version of curseforge as hytale is currently unsupported (I use bottles)
3. update your script to where your server is located
4. run the script ./hytale_sync

The script should remove out of date mods and add the up date date ones, when you update mods through curseforge you can simply run this script afterwards.

more features coming later sill learning stuff \./
